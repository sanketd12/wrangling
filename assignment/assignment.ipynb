Categorical variable: For the Minnesota police use of for data, `./data/mn_police_use_of_force.csv`, clean the `subject_injury` variable, handling the NA's; this gives a value `Yes` when a person was injured by police, and `No` when no injury occurred. What proportion of the values are missing? Is this a concern? Cross-tabulate your cleaned `subject_injury` variable with the `force_type` variable. Are there any patterns regarding when the data are missing? \n",

The cross-tabulation shows that when force is used, injuries are sometimes recorded, but in many cases, there is no injury reported. However, the high number of missing values raises some questions about whether injuries were not recorded properly, which could indicate gaps in data collection or reporting."
